# Evaluating the Math Performance of NY State Middle Schools

_Version 1.0_  
_Author(s): Jon Reifschneider_

# Case Scenario
You have recently been engaged on a consulting assignment by the NY State Department of Education to identify ways to improve the math performance of middle school students across the state. The DoE believes that NY middle school students are not performing at a competitive level to other states in the country.

The DoE has limited resources and would like to make data-driven decisions on how to deploy those resources to have maximum effect on the overall math performance of the state's middle school children. One way to define success for our client by looking at the average increase in math scores as a result of the actions that we recommend, relative to historical year-over-year trends.

One of the main factors under control of the DoE is where to allocate their annual budget, e.g. how to distribute it amongst the counties and schools in the state. Our hypothesis is that by identifying the most grossly underperforming areas of the state and allocating more of the budget to those areas, we can maximize the impact of our dollars available to spend. Our analysis today will focus on identifying the worst performing schools and counties in mathematics, in order to help the DoE make budget allocation decisions.
